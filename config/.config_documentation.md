## How to set configs
### 1. SSD metric
|parameter|type|description|
|---|:---:|---|
|threshold_mode|int|mode(1 or 2):<br />1 means static threshold, final threshold equal to ssd_threshold.<br />2 means dynamic threshold, final threshold equal to ssd_threshold * src_node.radius|
|ssd_threshold|float| For each node in gold standard tree, ssd find its closest node in test tree. If the distance of these two nodes is less than ssd_threshold, this node is successfully reconstructed and it will contribute to recall or precision, otherwise the distance will be contribute to ssd score. |
|up_sample_threshold|float|up sample rate of gold standard and test test tree. Smaller sample rate threshold means higher sample rate, denser upsampled tree. 
|scale|tuple(1*3)| scaling of gold and test tree in x,y,z coordinates. 
|debug|boolean|show debug information or not|

### 2. length metric
|parameter|type|description|
|---|:---:|---|
|rad_mode|int|mode(1 or 2):<br />1 means static threshold, final threshold equal to rad_threshold.<br />2 means dynamic threshold, final threshold equal to rad_threshold * src_node.radius|
|rad_threshold|float|This threshold measures the distance between nodes on gold standard tree and the closest edge on test tree. 
|len_threshold|float|This threshold measures the difference between edges on gold standard tree and their corresponding trace on test tree.  
|scale|tuple(1*3)|scaling of gold and test tree in x,y,z coordinates. |
|debug|boolean|show debug information or not|

### 3. branch metric
|parameter|type|description|
|---|:---:|---|
|threshold_dis|float| If the distance of two nodes on two trees is less than this threshold, they are probably matched. 
|scale|tuple(1*3)| scaling of gold and test tree in x,y,z coordinates.|
|true_positive_type|int| Identify the type of true positive nodes in swc. (This and following two parameters may affect the color of nodes in visualization program) | 
|false_negative_type|int| Identify the type of false negative nodes in swc. |
|false_positive_type|int| Identify the type of false positive nodes in swc. |

### 4. diadem metric
|parameter|type|description|
|---|:---:|---|
|weight_mode|int|Choose different map between degree and weight.<br/>(a). WEIGHT_DEGREE = 1<br/>weight is the degree of node <br/>(b). WEIGHT_SQRT_DEGREE = 2<br/>weight is the sqrt of degree <br/>(c). WEIGHT_DEGREE_HARMONIC_MEAN = 3<br/>weight is the harmonic mean of degree of left and right son. <br/>(d). WEIGHT_PATH_LENGTH = 4<br/>weight is the length of path from node to its root<br/>|
|remove_spur|boolean| remove spur or not |
|count_excess_nodes|boolean| count excess nodes in test tree or not | 
|list_miss|boolean| list missed nodes(reconstruct failed nodes) or not|
|list_distant_matches|boolean| distant match means the parent of a branch is not a matched node, but ancestor is. If this branch is matched, they are distant matched| 
|list_continuations|boolean| Continuation refer to nodes with only one one. List this kind of nodes or not. |
|find_proper_root|boolean| find a pair of matched node as roots of two trees or not |
|scale|tuple(1*3)|scaling of gold and test tree in x,y,z coordinates.|
|xy_threshold|float| node distance threshold in xy surface.|
|z_threshold|float| node distance threshold in z axis. |
|default_xy_path_error_threshold|float| path length difference threshold in xy surface. 
|default_z_path_error_threshold|float| path length difference threshold in z axis. |
|debug|boolean| show debug information or not |

### 5. link metric
|parameter|type|description|
|---|:---:|---|
|scale|tuple(1*3)|scaling of gold and test tree in x,y,z coordinates.|
